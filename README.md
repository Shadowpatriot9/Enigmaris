## Introduction
This is a password generator where the main focus of its design is to have the password generated secured and the whole application be lightweight in deployment.

## Getting Started
1. Complete 'Installation' section below
2. Check and sync your email to it for the email sharing option (I'll include better instruction on this once I make it better lol)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone
```
2. Run the 'main.py' in a Python interpreter

## Usage
Once the CLI session starts, it will walk you through the prompts to generate password.
