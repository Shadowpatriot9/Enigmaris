CN (Customer Needs | What are your needs?)
    Need a random pwd generator
    Needs to be able to adjust amount of characters
    Needs to include letters and numbers and special characters
    Needs to not retain pwds for security purposes
    Needs the ability to generate more than one if needed but default to one
    Needs to be extremely lightweight
    Needs to be universal
    Needs to have sharing option (send to a friend, quick copy and paste features for starters)
    Needs to have a simple UI (half asleep five-year-old)

CF (Customer Filtration | What are the most critical?)
    Randomness
    Security (no pwd retention, hardening of pwd generation method for starters)
    Accessibility (sharing, UI simplicity, lightweight)

    All others are 2nd

CS (Concept Sketch | Basic Layout of Design)
    Keep it to a python window for the moment/terminal
    When generating, use a randomness function but then encrypt it via AES256 and then let the terminal decrypt it (too messy out fo the gate?)
    Have a drop down/separate if character customization needed but have a prompt for how many characters the pwd needs (ticking slider only if have gui. ticking like an Apple slider)
    For sharing, have it automatically copied to clipboard w/visual confirmation and have an option to share it to SMS, other apps etc...
    GUI or terminal? (HTML GUI?)
        Python to start but HTML down the line due to easy accessibility and make sure the page can open with even the slowest of connections)
        That way the user doesnt need to install any programs, sign up for any acct, can access it on any device, with the only downside of needing a internet connection and to harden the source code from inspect element
    For the customization stuff, let it have the following: character exclusions, number of pwds to be generated (it for the moment)
    So prompts will be (with options already shown of how many pwds are being created with what type of characters): how many characters in the pwd, generated pwd and automaticallly copied to clipboard, Press S to Share E to Exit or R to restart (yes <-- I like it. E for exit instead of Q cause E easier to type in relation to R and S keys)

CP (Customer Prototype | Test)
    Alright, lets rock and roll

CF (Customer Feedback | Criticism)


Reiterate


***In Progress Design Notes***:
Need a pwd character amount limit of 100 (done)
Need a list reset for character customization (done)
Need a character customization bypass from intro (done)
Need an option for upper and lower case letters
